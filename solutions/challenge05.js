Challenge #5 - You get a job, she gets a job, he gets a job!

INSTRUCTIONS
Now that a crew has been selected, you need to write a new function that will assign a job to each astronaut. 
Since youâ€™ve had some experience with updating object properties in some of the previous challenges, this should be fairly straightforward. 
Just keep in mind that you need to return the astronaut after updating the job property.

EXAMPLES 
Input:
  const exampleAstronaut = {
    firstName:"Chris",
    lastName: "Hadfield",
    nickname:"Space Oddity",
    prefix:"Astronaut"
  }
Output: 
  const exampleAstronaut = {
    firstName:"Chris",
    lastName: "Hadfield",
    nickname:"Space Oddity",
    prefix:"Astronaut",
    job:"Shuttle DJ"
  }
  
*****************************************/

const addJobToAstronaut = (astronaut, job) => {
  astronaut.job = job;
  return astronaut;
}

// Test function
const exampleAstronaut = {
  firstName:"Chris",
  lastName: "Hadfield",
  nickname:"Space Oddity",
  prefix:"Astronaut"
}

console.log(addJobToAstronaut(exampleAstronaut, "Shuttle DJ"));
